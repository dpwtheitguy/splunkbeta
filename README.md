# SPlunk Configs

Building a quick set of configs that mimics standards so that I can build lab environments quickly and consistently.


#todo
1) disable API by default
2) Create an app to enable the API
3) default should deployment server
4) Create an app to disable it
5) Add the rest of Burches apps
6) Go through and update readme and app.conf files
7) Get practices around /etc/passwd and user-seed.conf
8) Finish forking the backup app, the default needs work
9) Get Splunk admins tools as part of the basic config
10) Get email configs into the defaults
